# library-management-system

A console library management system built on persistent CSV data.

## Data source

The raw book data (`books.csv`, not tracked in this repo due to size) comes from:

**Best Books Ever Dataset** — [https://zenodo.org/records/4265096](https://zenodo.org/records/4265096)

Download it and place it in this folder as `books.csv` before running the scripts below.

## Progress so far

### `clean_csv.py`
Builds `books_catalogue.csv` from the raw `books.csv`, keeping only `bookId, title, author, isbn`. Cleaning steps applied:
- Filters to `language == "English"` rows only
- Handles inconsistent numeric columns via `ignore_errors=True`
- Extracts the numeric prefix of `bookId` (e.g. `"2767052-the-hunger-games"` → `2767052`) and dedupe
- Keeps only rows where `isbn` is fully numeric, and dedupe
- Strips role annotations like `(Illustrator)`, `(Editor)` from `author`
- Drops truncated `"more…"` entries and non-Latin-script names from `author`, and flattens accented Latin characters (e.g. `é` → `e`)
- Drops rows with corrupted/mojibake titles or fully non-Latin-script titles, and strips stray stylized symbols (e.g. `★`, `™`, `→`) from the rest

Output: `books_catalogue.csv` (columns: `bookId, title, author, isbn`)

### `generate_inventory.py`
Generates `books_inventory.csv` from `books_catalogue.csv` with dummy copy counts for each book:
- `total_copies`: random single-digit value (1-9)
- `available_copies`: random value between 0 and `total_copies` (never exceeds it)

Output: `books_inventory.csv` (columns: `bookId, total_copies, available_copies`)

## Planned next steps
- `loans.csv` — loan history (`bookId, memberId, checkout_date, checkin_date`)
- `members.csv` — dummy member records (`memberId, member_name`)
